# faceID_beta
An implementation of iPhone X's FaceID using face embeddings and siamese networks on RGBD images.

You can read more about my implementation details at this <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-i-implemented-iphone-xs-faceid-using-deep-learning-in-python-d5dbaa128e1d">link</a>.

The .py file is created automatically from the notebook file, so you could find a strange ordering of code and functions. I **highly suggest to use the notebook version**.
